# CAR SERVICE

The project takes data from a json file. Then from the console we have the ability to manage cars.
Project written in learning Python, JSON, data management, data validation and testing. 

I plan to add a database layer and UI (FastAPI, Flask).


## Built With
- Python
- Pytest
- Unittest
- Poetry
- MySQL
- Docker


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SzymiYay/easy-cars-service-1
   ```
2. To start the project, you need to have Python and Poetry installed on your computer.
3. Set on the project directory.
4. Run application:
   ```sh
   poetry run pyhton -m cars_app
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```
   
## Usage
Example JSON:
```json
[
  {
    "model": "BMW",
    "price": 120,
    "color": "BLACK",
    "mileage": 1500,
    "components": [
      "ABS",
      "ALLOY WHEELS"
    ]
  },
  {
    "model": "MAZDA",
    "price": 160,
    "color": "WHITE",
    "mileage": 2500,
    "components": [
      "AIR CONDITIONING",
      "BLUETOOTH"
    ]
  }
]
```

From the json file, download the data. Then, using the get_cars function to validate the data, 
place it in an array and create a CarsService object.
Having such an object, you can manage the data in various ways

```python
def main() -> None:
   FILENAME: Final[str] = 'cars_app/data/cars.json'
   cars_data = get_cars_data(FILENAME)
   cars = get_cars(cars_data)
   cars_service = CarsService(cars)

   print(cars_service.get_cars_with_mileage_greater_than(1500))
   print(cars_service.get_color_and_no_of_cars())
   print(cars_service.get_model_and_most_expensive_car())

```
